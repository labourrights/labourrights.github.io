              <p>If you ask different people on the streets, you will get different answers. A right is some sort of freedom granted to you to enable you to do things. The concept of 'Human Rights' is based on the fact that each person is a moral and rational being who deserves to be treated with dignity. That means everyone is equal. People can have their own job, partner and career. No one can decide for you. People start to realse the importance of human rights after WWII, where abuses of human rights in places like concentration camps were widespread. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that people have 30 kinds of basic human rights. This website will cover labour rights, Article 23 of 30.

("Universal Declaration Of Human Rights | United Nations") The main concept behind Article 23 was protecting the rights of the workers, ensuring that the workplace is not a hazard to their physical, mental and social health.</p>

              <p>The issue of labour rights was first brought up by the Peasants’ Revolt, happening in England in June 1381. When the Black Death ended almost 35 years ago relative to the revolt, manors and owners handed peasants many labour rights so as to encourage them to work for the manors and owners. However, many peasants feared that their masters would take back these privileges. Peasants had to work for free on church lands, sometimes up to two days every week.This caused them to not be able to work on their own lands which made it difficult to grow food for their families. In 1380, the Poll Tax was introduced by Richard II. Everyone had to pay 5 pence, which was not a small amount at the time. If the peasants could not pay in money, they had to pay with everyday necessities. One priest, John Ball, realised this and decided to gather up peasants for a revolt; the Tower of London was taken, the archbishop was killed and negotiations were made with King Richard V. As a result, the concept of ‘labour rights’ was born. ("Peasants Revolt - History Learning Site")</p>

              <p>In the Middle Ages in England, there was a concept of maximum wages, in which landlords cannot pay their peasants more than the maximum wage. This was implemented to make sure that peasants have no chance to become stronger. As time passed on, different people started to believe that minimum wages should appear too. The concept of minimum wages was based on maximum wages, and eventually an ‘Act Fixing a Minimum Wage’ was issued in 1604 by King James I. This Act gave the term ‘Minimum Wage’ official recognition and definition, and was the start of a series of movement to create minimum wages around the world. The influence extended centuries later, when many other countries started adopted the concept of minimum wages.</p>

              <p>In the 19th century, many workers had to work for 10-16 hours daily for 6 days a week. This meant that many people did not have any time for recreation and had an extremely unhealthy social life. Robert Owens, a Welsh social reformer, proposed 10 hour days for workers in 1810. 7 years later, he changed 10 hours to 8 hours, advocating for ‘Eight hours' labour, Eight hours' recreation, Eight hours' rest.’ The International Working Men’s (IWA) association was formed by unsatisfied workers in England and France. One of the fundamental beliefs of The Geneva Congress of the (IWA) in 1866 was the establishment of 8 hour days all around the world. However, not many countries actually adopted the 8 hour day at the time. New Zealand adopted the 8 hour day in the 1840s and in Australia the Australian Labour Movement led by activists successfully established the 8 hour day. Most countries adopted the concept early 20th century, and was mentioned by the Treaty of Versailles. ("Workers Online : February 2005 : The Eight Hour Day And The Holy Spirit")</p>

              <p>This disaster happened in New York on March 25, 1911. The fire killed 146 people with the majority being women. Almost everyone in the factory died, a lot of them from trying to escape through jumping out of the window. The main reason why the fire killed so many people is because the boss of the company did not want the workers smoke or even leave the factory during break times, so he blocked all the emergency exits. This fire stimulated the government to make laws such as: The factory needs to mandated better building access and egress, fireproofing requirements, the availability of fire extinguishers, the installation of alarm systems and automatic sprinklers, better eating and toilet facilities for workers, and limited the number of hours that women and children could work.

                The Act Fixing a Minimum Wage showed official respect of the wages of workers, recognising and defining the term 'minimum wage'. This showed that the government cares if workers are getting enough money to be able to live. Even though this event did not get immediate echoing in many other countries, similar actions were echoed centuries later.

                The Eight Hour Day Campaigns showed that workers need a balance between work, leisure and rest. Humans are not robots that can operate 24/7, and if workers do not get their needs, productivity will start to decrease. This campaign also allowed many workers to join in a trade union. Although these trade unions did not last long, they were the predecessors of modern trade unions that fight for labour rights.

      <div class="jumbotron">
        <p>Labour Rights are very important. They are able to protect the workers who are essential to producing things we use everyday. Without official establishment labour rights in Article 23 of the UDHR, these labourers will still be working in terrible conditions. They wouldn't be able to form trade unions to protect their own rights and fight against unfair treatment. Labour Rights is one of the most fundamental rights brought up in the Middle Ages. Its importance to the development of Human Rights is huge. It is one of the older Human Rights, and different movements for Labour Rights have shown to many others that fighting for different Human Rights is worth it and can be fruitful. Labour Rights were one of the first rights to be mentioned in the laws and regulations of countries, and paved the way for other rights to be established.</p>
